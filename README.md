# Ocolos: Online COde Layout OptimizationS
Ocolos is the first _online_ code layout optimization system for unmodified applications written in unmanaged languages. Ocolos allows profile-guided optimization to be performed on a running process, instead of being performed offline and requiring the application to be re-launched. A description of how we implemented Ocolos and experimental results on MySQL-sysbench workloads are in [MICRO'22 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9923868).

For the demonstration purpose, we integrate `MySQL` and `sysbench` to Ocolos, so this version of Ocolos ONLY works with `MySQL`.

## Download ocolos for mysql
```bash
> git clone git@github.com:upenn-acg/ocolos-public.git
```


## Install BOLT 
To use `llvm-bolt` and `perf2bolt` utilities, `BOLT` needs to be installed. \
Please follow the commands below to install `BOLT` 
```bash
> mkdir BOLT && cd BOLT
> git clone git@github.com:upenn-acg/BOLT.git llvm-bolt
> cd llvm-bolt
> git checkout ocolos/cont-opt
> cd ..
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm-bolt/llvm -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;AArch64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld;bolt"
> make -j
```


## Build MySQL from source 
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server.git 
> cd mysql-server 
> git checkout 6846e6b2f72931991cc9fd589dc9946ea2ab58c9 
```
In `CMakeList.txt`, at line 580, please add [^2]: 
[^2]: If the mysqld binary compiled by gcc generates `callq` instructions rather than `call` instructions, please refer to the solution discussed in [this page](https://github.com/upenn-acg/ocolos-public/issues/1).
```
STRING_APPEND(CMAKE_C_FLAGS  " -fno-jump-tables")
STRING_APPEND(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS " -fno-jump-tables")
STRING_APPEND(CMAKE_C_FLAGS " -no-pie")
STRING_APPEND(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS " -no-pie")
```
Also, in `CMakeList.txt`, turn off `ld.gold` linker: \
change `OPTION(USE_LD_GOLD "Use GNU gold linker" ON)` to be `OPTION(USE_LD_GOLD "Use GNU gold linker" OFF)`

Then build `mysqld` from source:
```bash
> export CC=gcc 
> export CXX=g++
> mkdir build && cd build 
> cmake .. -DWITH_BOOST={path of the boost_1_73_0 directory} -DCMAKE_CXX_LINK_FLAGS=-Wl,--emit-relocs -DCMAKE_C_LINK_FLAGS=-Wl,--emit-relocs -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release 
> make -j
> make install
```


To initialize MySQL, run:
```bash
> chown -R {user} {path to MySQL directory}
> {path to MySQL directory}/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=root --datadir={your data dir path of MySQL} 
> {path to MySQL directory}/bin/mysqld --user=root --port=3306 --datadir={your data dir path of MySQL}
```
In another terminal, run:
```bash
> mysql -u root
> CREATE USER 'ocolos'@'localhost';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ocolos'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
> CREATE DATABASE ocolos_db;
> QUIT;
> mysqladmin -u root shutdown
```
_Note_: 
1. {path to MySQL directory} is normally `/usr/local/mysql` unless otherwise specified during MySQL server's installation.  
2. {user} should be your linux user name. 


## Build Sysbench 
```bash
> sudo apt-get update 
> sudo apt-get install sysbench
```
Or if you prefer to build sysbench from source, please refer instructions in the following webpage:\
[https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) 


## Build & run Ocolos
- Navigate to `ocolos-public` directory.  
- In the file `config`, specify the absolute path for `nm`,`perf`,`objdump`,`llvm-bolt`,`perf2bolt` [^3]
   [^3]: if `nm`,`objdump` and `perf` are already in shell, it's OK that their paths are not specified in `config`. This can be checked by `which nm`, `which objdump` and `which perf`.
- In `config`, please also specify the commands to run `MySQL server` and `sysbench`. The example commands are given in the config file. 
   * _Note_: the first argument of the command (a.k.a. the binary being invoked in the command) should be written in its full path. 
- Please also remember to export the path of `ocolos-public`'s directory.
```bash
> export OCOLOS_PATH=/your/path/to/ocolos-public
```
- Then run the following commands:

```bash
> make
> ./extract_call_sites
> ./tracer

```
- `make` will produce 2 executables (`tracer` & `extract_call_sites`)+ 1 shared library (`replace_function.so`). 
   * If libunwind library is stored in other places instead of `/usr/local/lib`, you also need to edit Makefile and update it to the corresponding path.
   * If libunwind's header files are stored in other places instead of `/usr/local/include`, you also need to edit Makefile and update it to the corresponding path. 
- `./extract_call_sites` will produce 2 files which store all call sites information extracted from the target binary (a.k.a. `mysqld`) to the `tmp_data_dir` you specified in the config file. 
- `./tracer` will invoke both `MySQL` server process and sysbench workloads `oltp_read_only`, and then perform code layout optimization during runtime. 
   * The output of sysbench's throughput can be found in `sysbench_output.txt`. At about the 130th second, you will see a significant throughput improvement, since Ocolos has replace the code layout to be the optimized one at that time.
   * After one run (~3 minutes), if you want to start another run, please first run `mysqladmin -u root shutdown` command to shutdown the current `MySQL` server process. 


## UPDATES: Continuous Optimization - use profile from C1 to build new BOLTed binary
- We've modified `BOLT` to make it support converting `perf.data` collected from C1 to be the `perf.fdata` that `llvm-bolt` can use.
   * Here, we have the new terms `C0` & `C1`
      + `C0` : The duration before `Ocolos`'s code replacement 
      + `C1` : The duration after `Ocolos`'s code replacement 
   * The `BOLT`'s code supports continuous optimization can be found [here](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT).
- In `C0`, the `perf2bolt` and `llvm-bolt` commands are changed to :
```bash
> perf2bolt -p perf_c0.data -o perf_c0.fdata mysqld
> llvm-bolt mysqld -o mysqld_c0.bolt --enable-bat --enable-func-map-table -data=perf_c0.fdata -reorder-blocks=cache+ -reorder-functions=hfsort
```
- In `C1`, to make profile collected from `C1` work with `perf2bolt`, and then to produce C1's `mysqld.bolt` for next round of code replacement, the `perf2bolt` and `llvm-bolt` commands are changed to :
   * In the `perf2bolt` command, `callstack_func.bin` & `BOLTed_bin_info.txt` are produced by `Ocolos` during C0's code replacement, since we need to pass some essential information from `Ocolos` to `BOLT`
```bash
> perf2bolt --ignore-build-id --cont-opt --call-stack-func=callstack_func.bin --bin-path-info=BOLTed_bin_info.txt -p perf_c1.data -o perf_c1.fdata mysqld_c0.bolt
> llvm-bolt mysqld -o mysqld_c1.bolt --enable-bat --enable-func-map-table -data=perf_c1.fdata -reorder-blocks=cache+ -reorder-functions=hfsort
```      
- We also have a script to show how continuous optimization works 
   * The script does the following things:
      + shows how to use the profile collected from Ocolos' C1 + the `mysqld.bolt` produced from Ocolos' C0 to build a newly BOLTed binary
      + runs the newly BOLTed binary with `oltp_read_only` to show the throughput
   * The script can be found [Here](https://github.com/upenn-acg/ocolos-public/blob/main/scripts/C1_BOLTed_performance_test.sh). 
      + before running the script, please change the paths in the script.
      + also, please add `-DCONT_OPT` to `CXXFLAGS` in Makefile, and compile `Ocolos` again. 
      + run this script `sh scripts/C1_BOLTed_performance_test.sh`

## UPDATES: Support for the AArch64 platform
- Thanks to Wenlong who contributed to Ocolos, making it also work for the AArch64 platform.
- The link to the version that supports AArch64 platform can be found [here](https://github.com/onroadmuwl/ocolos-public-aarch64).

## Miscellaneous (notes about how to debug Ocolos)
In `Makefile`'s `CXXFLAGS`,
- if `-DTIME_MEASUREMENT` flag is added, Ocolos will print the execution time of code replacement;
- if `-DMEASUREMENT` flag is added, Ocolos will print metrics such as:  
  * the number of functions on the call stack when target process is paused,
  * the number of functions that are moved by `BOLT`,
  * the number of functions that are in the `BOLT` and original functions.
- if `-DDEBUG_INFO` flag is added, Ocolos will print debug information such as:
  * the information about detailed behavior of tracer
  * the content in the call stack when the target process is paused
  * `-DDEBUG_INFO` can also be defined in `src/replace_function.hpp`. In this way, the ld_preload library will store all machine code per function it inserted to the target process as a `uint8_t` format array into a file. The file can be found in the `tmp_data_path` you defined in the config file. 
- if `-DDEBUG` flag is added, after code replacement, Ocolos will first send `SIGSTOP` signal to target process and then resume the target process by `PTRACE_DETACH`. In this way, it allows debugging tools such as `GDB` to attach to the target process and observe what goes wrong after code replacement.

If the code replacement runs into a failure, you may want to do the following things to fix this problem
- first add the `-DDEBUG_INFO` to `CXXFLAGS` in Makefile and compile again.
- then run `./tracer` 
- after `tracer` run into an error, you can check `{tmp_data_dir}/machine_code.txt`'s last few lines
- if the last few lines shows that the error is caused by `mmap failed. file exists.`
   + it indicates that the BOLTed text section overlaps with the heap of the running `mysqld` process. 
   + to solve this problem, please comment out [this line](https://github.com/upenn-acg/ocolos-public/blob/main/src/replace_function.cpp#L246) in `replace_function.cpp`, and then compile Ocolos again.
